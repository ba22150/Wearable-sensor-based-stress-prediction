# Wearable-sensor-based-stress-prediction
In this project we have been tasked with investigating whether the wearable sensor can be used to predict stress.We will analyse a set of data obtained from 35 people who participated in a pilot test to see if the sensors are capable of detecting stress. With an emphasis on preventing false negatives and making sure the gadget is efficient , the objective is to develop a novel feature that informs users when they are becoming stressed.In this project, We will be exploring the signals being recorded, processing them, and presenting our findings concisely to the company.
