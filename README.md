# Wearable-sensor-based-stress-prediction
In this project we have been tasked with investigating whether the wearable sensor can be used to predict stress.We will analyse a set of data obtained from 35 people who participated in a pilot test to see if the sensors are capable of detecting stress. With an emphasis on preventing false negatives and making sure the gadget is efficient , the objective is to develop a novel feature that informs users when they are becoming stressed.In this project, We will be exploring the signals being recorded, processing them, and presenting our findings concisely to the company.





# Usage
1.	Download the dataset from https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/21/8135
2.	Extract the downloaded data folder and then save the data into the same folder as the juypter notebook.
3.	Run the Assignment 2(CE888).ipynb or Assignment 2(CE888).py to load the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), select features, pre-process the data and train the machine learning model for stress prediction. 
4.	The file contains code snippets for data pre-processing, EDA, feature selection, model development, and model evaluation.
5.	Once the model is trained, we can use it to predict stress based on the dataset.
